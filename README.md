# Star Citizen Ship Database

This app will display the ships available in the game Star Citizen (SC). Start Citizen is being developed by Roberts Space Industries (RSI) and is a high tech space simulation game. Not having a machine capable of properly handling the game I can't attest to the game-play, but i do enjoy checking in on it's development and design.

One of the things i thought this little app could do was provide a way to search through and filter certain aspects of the games ship line up that aren't available in the games normal site. 

Current features:

* One of the first features is the ability to easily see which ships have brochures created for them and a link to download / view those brochures. 

* Another feature would be to link to the RSI store page for each ship to find the official data, information, and extensive views for each ship.

Manage your application's state using Hooks and the Context API.
Structure, document, and deploy your final project code according to common industry practices.

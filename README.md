# Star Citizen Ship Database

This app will display the ships available in the game Star Citizen (SC). Start Citizen is being developed by Roberts Space Industries (RSI) and is a high tech space simulation game. Not having a machine capable of properly handling the game I can't attest to the game-play, but i do enjoy checking in on it's development and design.

One of the things i thought this little app could do was provide a way to search through and filter certain aspects of the games ship line up that aren't available in the games normal site. 

Current features:

* One of the first features is the ability to easily see which ships have brochures created for them and a link to download / view those brochures. 

* Another feature would be to link to the RSI store page for each ship to find the official data, information, and extensive views for each ship.
